#### Rényi Divergence
Before we go into Rényi DP, we need to understand what Rényi divergence is. Rényi divergence is a way of measuring the matching between two distributions. It’s formally defined as follows:

$$
D_\alpha(P||Q) = \frac{1}{\alpha - 1}log(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{p_{i}^{\alpha}}{q_{i}^{\alpha - 1}})
$$

when $$0< \alpha < \infty$$ and $$\alpha \neq 1$$. We can define the Rényi divergence for the special values $$\alpha = 0, 1, \infty$$ by taking a limit.

#### Formal definition of Rényi DP
Rényi differential privacy (RDP)[^1] is a generalization of ε-differential privacy. A randomized mechanism $$M$$ is said to have: Rényi DP of order $$\alpha$$, or $$(\alpha,\epsilon)$$-RDP, if for any neighbouring databases $$x$$ and $$x'$$, it holds that, 

$$
D_\alpha(M(x)||M(x')) \le \epsilon
$$

A mechanism satisfying ε-DP is equivalent to saying that it satisfies RDP of order $$\infty$$. RDP gives privacy guarantees that are somewhere between ε-DP and $$(\epsilon, \delta)$$ -DP.
