Hello, I am Fiza, trying to distill recent learnings into bite-sized insights. <br><br>
I am currently working as a Research Fellow at Microsoft. I graduated with a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) in 2022. 

Aside from tech, I indulge in my passion for the arts. Drawing and painting in various mediums allows me to express my creative side, and you can find my latest creations on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fiza_husain). I absolutely love cats and mathematics!
